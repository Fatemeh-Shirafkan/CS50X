sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: All three reverse number files were tested with all sort files
and sort 1 returned a longer time than the rest of the files,
and considering that bubble sort has a longer performance in sorting numbers in reverse than others,
so sort 1 is bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:All three sort files were tested on reverse number files,
 and as a result, sort 2 had the least time in sorting files,
 which works better in the Merge sort method for reverse numerical files,
 so the sort 2 file is equal to Merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: According to the above results, only the sort3 file remains,
so the selection sort,
and also that the time obtained from testing this file on numerical files was the opposite of the normal and average time compared to the previous two methods.
